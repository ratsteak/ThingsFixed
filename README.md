## Update Firefox and Thunderbird to the last version in Debian Stable
Due to the old problems in Debian with Mozilla i wrote some scripts to keep Firefox and Thunderbird updated to the last version in Debian Stable.

Just replace the lines like:
https://download.mozilla.org/?product=firefox-latest&os=linux64&lang=es-ES for other language or version.
